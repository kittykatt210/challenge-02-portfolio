# challenge-02-portfolio

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
As a budding full stack developer I know it is important to have a single location where I can showcase my work. This allows me, as well as others, not only see the work I have done but to see my progession in this craft.
- Why did you build this project? 
The purpose of the this project was to start a portfolio of my work that I can continue to add to.
- What problem does it solve?
Having this portfolio page allows easy access to my work. It also keeps my work in a single, easily viewable location without having to go to various webpages. Additionally, it provides my contact information as well as my updated resume.
- What did you learn?
This pproject taught me that it is important to have an idea of what you want your page to look like and have it drawn out - a wireframe. Just like anything else in life, a plan is important! If you have an idea drawn out it is much easier to code. I also learned that I have a propensity to work on a section at a time, doing both HTML and CSS coding. As a visual person it is hard for me to code all of the HTML first and then add the styling.
