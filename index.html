      <h3 class="headings">About Me:</h3>
      <p>
        In 2017 I retired from the U.S. Air Force after serving 21 years. I
        worked in the Materiel Management career field and my duties included
        things such as ordering aircraft parts, managing warehouses, inventory
        control, and quality assurance. During my time in service I had seven
        assignments that included England (twice), Alaska, Arizona, Okinawa,
        Nebraska, and Korea. I also had several deployments that included Qatar,
        Iraq, and Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
        After retiring from the Air Force I pursued a Bachelors of Science
        degree in Applied Mathematics. Once I completed that I went on to get my
        Bachelors of Business Administration in Computer Information Systems
        with a concentration in Business Analytics. It was during my BBA time
        that I interned for USAA as a Data Engineer in the Anti Money Laundering
        department. Upon completetion of my degree I was offered, and accepted, a
        full time position with USAA.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my down time I enjoy traveling, although I don't get out as much as I
        did when I lived overseas. One of my biggest hobbies, or obsessions
        depending on how one looks at it, is Lego! I am constantly on the hunt
        for new sets and forever putting them together. While I do not have
        children, I do have one very special dog. She is my Husk-ahua-oodle - a
        mix of husky, chihuahua and poodle. She has the vocal chords of a husky,
        the protectiveness of a chihuahua and the softness of a poodle...and
        more personalities than she knows what to do with!

      <h3 class="headings">Work:</h3>
      <p>
        I have only begun my journey as a full stack web developer and as such,
        my portfolio is not robust. However stay tuned... there will be more to
        come in the future!
      </p>
      <p>
        Current work includes the following from my Full Stack Bootcamp: <br />
        <strong>Pre-Work Project</strong> - <em>just to get a taste of putting together a webpage</em><br />
        <strong>Refactoring Code Project</strong> - <em>made the page accessability friendly</em><br />
        <strong>Code Quiz Project</strong> - <em>A timed quiz with questions covering JavaScript</em><br />
        <strong>Icebreakers for the Socially Awkward</strong> - <em>A place where you can get random
        facts and jokes to help break the ice</em><br />
        and More to Come...
