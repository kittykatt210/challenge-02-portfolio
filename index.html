    <article id="about-me" class="content">
        <h3 class="headings">About Me:</h3>
        <p>In 2017 I retired from the U.S. Air Force after serving 21 years. I worked in the Materiel Management career field and my duties included things such as ordering aircraft parts, managing warehouses, inventory control, and quality assurance. During my time in service I had seven assignments that included England (twice), Alaska, Arizona, Okinawa, Nebraska, and Korea. I also had several deployments that included Qatar, Iraq, and Afghanistan.</p><br>
        <p>After retiring from the Air Force I pursued a Bachelors of Science degree in Applied Mathematics. Once I completed that I went on to get my Bachelors of Business Administration in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Business Analytics. It was during my BBA time that I interned for USAA as a Data Engineer in the Anti Money Laundering department.Upon completetion of my degree I was offered, and accepted, a full time position with USAA.</p><br>
        <p>In my down time I enjoy traveling, although I don't get out as much as I did when I lived overseas. One of my biggest hobbies, or obsessions depending on how one looks at it, it Lego! I am constantly on the hunt for new sets and forever putting them together. While I do not have children, I do have one very special dog. She is my Husk-ahua-oodle - a mix of husky, chihuahua and poodle. She has the vocal chords of a husky, the protectiveness of a chihuahua and the softness of a poodle...and more personalities than she knows what to do with!</p>

        <p>I have only begun my journey as a full stack web developer and as such, my portfolio is not robust. However stay tuned... there will be more to come in the future!</p><br>
